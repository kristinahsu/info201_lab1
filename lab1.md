# What I hope to learn in INFO 201
**Kristina Hsu**
In INFO 201, I hope to learn to interaction with the follows
- Terminal
- GitHub
- *R language*
I think that it may be a hard transition for me at first because I took CSE142, 143 and 163 and have been more familiar with *java* and *python*. But I am looking forward to built up the software of an information system.
